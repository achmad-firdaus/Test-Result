#### LIST
- [Test Case ðŸ‘»](#test-case-)
- [FPM CGI ðŸ‘»](#fpm-cgi-)
- [No FPM CGI ðŸ‘»](#no-fpm-cgi-)

#### TEST CASE ðŸ‘»
* I use AB tetst in Server(BIONIC) and cURL for request in Windows
* I will AB test with 2000 request and 1000 concurrency reuest

#### FPM CGI ðŸ‘»
USING INTERNET CONNECTION:
- I have used AB, cURL, Http Request and the result:

        cURL -> is normal and fast response
        
        AB ->

NOT USING INTERNET CONNECTION:
- Sometimes for the first time you use cURL it will be like this and so on it will be normal again:

       cURL & AB test is normal and fast response


#### NO FPM CGI ðŸ‘»
USING INTERNET CONNECTION:
- I have used cURL, Http Request and the result:

        Everything is normal

- But if there is an incorrect code, it will take a long time to request. This the result:
